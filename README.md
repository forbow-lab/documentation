# Paperpile Setup

When you open a Paperpile a/c, you many notice that you are not able to edit/highlight/underline pdf's in the Paperpile online PDF viewer. To enable these editing features, follow these steps:
1. In your Paperpile a/c, click the settings drop-down icon on the top right. 
2. A pop-up window will appear. At the bottom of this window, change the *Preferred PDF Viewer* to *Viewer with Annotations (beta)*.

That's it. Now you should be able to edit your PDFs using Paperpile.
